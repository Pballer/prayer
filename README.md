PrayerFrist

This is a site that allows users to login with an existing openID account.  From there each user is free to create groups(like Google+ groups) and make posts.  These posts are specifically meant to be prayer requests that can easily be shared with the world or limited to only be viewed by your groups.  Please take advantage of this app and send me any ideas for improvement.  Link to [PrayerFirst](http://172.245.128.156).  It is continued work on the microblog app mentioned below.

In the works:
Addition feature to use [Spritz](http://www.spritzinc.com/) to read the Bible.
